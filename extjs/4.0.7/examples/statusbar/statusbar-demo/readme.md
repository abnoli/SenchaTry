# StatusBar Examples #

Here are several examples of using and customizing the `Ext.ux.StatusBar` component.

## Basic StatusBar ##

This is a simple StatusBar with a few standard Toolbar items included.

## Right-Aligned StatusBar ##

This is a simple StatusBar that has the status element right-aligned.  Any StatusBar items will be added in exactly the same order on the left side of the bar.

## Status Window ##

You can add a StatusBar to a window in exactly the same way.

## Customizing the Look and Feel ##

This is a standard StatusBar with some custom CSS styles applied and some event handling in place to handle the TextArea's keypress events.  Notice that after you've stopped typing for a few seconds a simulated auto-save process will begin.
