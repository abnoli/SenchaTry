    <h1>MultiSelect &amp; ItemSelector</h1>
    
    <h2>MultiSelect</h2>
    <p>MultiSelect is a form field type that allows selection of one or more items from a list. The list is
    populated using a data Store. Items can be reordered via drag and drop if <code>ddReorder:true</code> is set.</p>
    <p>This example has <code>allowBlank:false</code> so a validation error will appear when the item's selections
    are cleared. Validations for <code>minSelections</code> and <code>maxSelections</code> can also be applied.</p>
    <div id="multiselect" class="demo-ct"></div>
    
    <h2>ItemSelector</h2>
    <p>ItemSelector is a specialized MultiSelect field that renders as a pair of MultiSelect field, one with
    available options and the other with selected options. A set of buttons in between allows items to be
    moved between the fields and reordered within the selection. Items can also be moved via drag and drop.
    All the same validations as MultiSelect are supported.</p>
