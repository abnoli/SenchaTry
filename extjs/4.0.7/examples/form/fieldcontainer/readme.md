# FieldContainer Example #

Several form fields can be placed onto the same row with a FieldContainer.
  
The FieldContainer's child items are arranged like in any other container, using the `layout` configuration property. In this example, each FieldContainer is set to use an HBox layout - [see the HBox docs for details](http://www.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.layout.HBoxLayout) or the [HBox layout example](../layout/hbox/index.html).
  
FieldContainers can be configured with the combineErrors option, which combines errors from the sub fields and presents them at the container level.</p>

In this example the Date Range, Phone and Full Name items have this option enabled, and the Time worked item does not. The [msgTarget](http://www.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.form.Labelable&member=msgTarget) config option is fully supported, so errors can be rendered to any of the supported locations.
