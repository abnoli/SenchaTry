# Localization with Ext #

This demonstrates a dutch location of Ext using the form component. It includes the localization file "ext-lang-nl.js" from the source/locale folder of the Ext download. By placing all language text such as field labels and button labels and date formats in the prototype, we can easily  localize our components by overriding these values.
